# APPLICATION SECTIONS:)
Our advise is to see the explicative video where it is shown sequentially what it is described here

## CHARGING
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 - 1: The first page concerns the charging. During this time only the necessary data from the database are downloded.
 
## HOME PAGE
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 - 2: First thing first we find ourselves inside the main page where four sections are well distinguishable  Musei, Rolli, Parchi e Chiese.
    - Slightly further down is a scrolling list displaying the most popular sites of interest. Their rating, of course, is an average of all the ratings that registered users of the application have left.
        
    - We then find another list, which simply shows other characteristic places to give the application user an idea of what they will find next.
        
    -  Below that, again on the central page, we find a brief description for the reader's convenience.

## POINTS OF INTEREST
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 - 3: Once we click on one of the symbols representing the chosen site, museums in this case, we are thrown into a page with all the places in that category in the database. As we scroll down this page, we really do have plenty of choices to choose from.
Entering the page of one of these, lantern of Genoa for example, we can see: 

   - There are five images for each place that make the place stand out in every profile
        
   - The address of the place; street and extension (if present, of course) will be displayed (If one clicks on the map icon, the user will already enter this one with the place he was viewing displayed in it)
        
   - Site opening and closing times
        
   - A detailed artistic-historical description to capture the attention of enthusiasts and to educate the young (and not only, because you never stop learning) in a different way.

## MAP
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- 4: Turning now to the map, we note that:
    - The central area of Genoa is displayed
    - There are 4 buttons at the bottom of the page to display all the places in the crushed category on the map.
    - A search bar to search for a particular site
    - A button to the left that allows you to view your location
    - By clicking on one of the chosen places, a short description and 3 more buttons appear. These allow a route to be created from the user's location to the destination in three simple ways, on foot, by bus or by car.

## WHO WE ARE
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- 5: This brings us to the 'About Us' page, where in addition to explaining who we are and what the purpose of the application is, there is a form for sending an e-mail to the developers (i.e. us) in order to ask questions, point out an interesting place that has not been included in its category, or point out errors in the pages of those already present. In order to do this, the user must be registered.

## PROFILE
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- 6: Last but not least, we have the profile page. After logging in (or after registering, in the case of new users) we enter the page dedicated only to the individual person holding an account. This can, from now on:

   - Save destinations that he/she has set as favourites
    
   - Send an email for various reasons (as mentioned before)
    
   - Give a rating from 0 to 5 for each place seen
    
   - Choose a profile photo so that other users can recognise it
